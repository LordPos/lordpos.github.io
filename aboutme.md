I'm a high-schooler, functional programming enthusiast (thanks Haskell), and competitive programmer. I work mostly on the backend side of things, and I enjoy reading and learning stuff.

I'm proficient in Python, Haskell, and Go and fairly fluent in Julia, Rust, Scheme and C++. I enjoy learning languages with radically different paradigms, so you're next, Prolog.

Quantum computation and Lambda calculus are neat.

My name is Harshith and I live in nowhere, India. Shoot an email at lordposeidon@vivaldi.net if you'd like to contact me for anything, I'm always up for cool side-projects.
